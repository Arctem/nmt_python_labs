\section{Tanks}

\begin{warningbox}{Dirtbags Tanks}
  This project is inspired by Dirtbags Tanks by Neale Pickett.
  More information is available at \url{http://woozle.org/tanks/intro.html}.
\end{warningbox}

\subsection{Project Overview}
You will be provided with several files comprising the Tank project. This is the
skeleton of a game involving several tanks. It consists of the files
\texttt{game.py}, \texttt{sample\_tank.py}, \texttt{sensor.py},
\texttt{tank.py}, and \texttt{tankutil.py}. For a description of what each of
these files do, stay here. For a description of your assignment, see
Section~\ref{subsec:ex}.

\subsection{Your Mission}
\label{subsec:ex}
You will be submitting 6 tanks that inherit from the \pythoninline{Tank} class
in \texttt{tank.py}. Each of your tanks should override, at the very least,
the \pythoninline{__init__} and \pythoninline{ai(self, delta)} methods of
the parent class.

\begin{ex}[coward.py]
%runs away from others
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[charger.py]
%aggressively pursues anything it sees
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[turret.py]
%can't move, aims at enemies
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[elephant.py]
%bigger, slower, harder to kill
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[mouse.py]
%smaller and faster
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[custom.py]
%your choice
\end{ex}

\section{Submitting}
You should submit your code as a tarball. It should contain all files
used in the exercises for this lab. The submitted file should be named
\begin{center}
  \texttt{cse107\_firstname\_lastname\_tanks.tar.gz}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \textbf{Upload your tarball to Canvas.}
