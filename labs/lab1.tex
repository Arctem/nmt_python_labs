\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to the Python programming
environment. In this lab, you will learn how to
\begin{enumerate*}
  \item log into a computer of the Tech Computer Center (ITC),
  \item learn how to use and navigate Linux,
  \item learn to use Python as an interpreter,
  \item edit and run a few short Python programs, as well as
  \item create a tarball and submit it to Canvas.
\end{enumerate*}

Throughout this semester's labs, we will be using specially formatted text to
aid in your understanding. For example,

\begin{bashcode}
text in a console font within a gray box
\end{bashcode}

is text that either appears in the terminal or is to be typed into the terminal
verbatim. Even the case is important, so be sure to keep it the same! If a \$ is
used that indicates the terminal prompt. You do not type the \$.

\begin{python3code}
Text that appears in console font within a framed box is sample Python code
or program output.
\end{python3code}

Text in a \texttt{simple console font}, without a frame or background, indicates
the name of a file, a function, or some action you need to perform.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Linux Environment}
\label{sec:linux}

The following instructions will guide you through the Linux introduction.
Because this is an introductory lab, the instructions are rather detailed and
specific. However, it is important that you understand the concepts behind the
actions you take -- you will be repeating them throughout the semester. If you
have any questions, ask the instructor, teaching assistant, or lab assistant.

\subsection{Log in}
To log into a ITC machine, you must use your ITC username and password. If you
do not have a ITC account, you must visit the ITC office (Speare 5) to have one
activated.

If your computer is currently booted with Windows, restart it and select Fedora
(a variety of Linux) as your operating system. Please note that using Linux is a
\emph{requirement} for this class.

\subsection{Open a Terminal}
In Linux, you will perform most actions from the command line. In order to do
this, you must first open a terminal. There are many methods for opening a
terminal; the following is just one.

% TODO: REVISE REVISE REVISE they use cinnamon now
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Click on the \texttt{Menu} button at the bottom left of the screen.
  \item In the text box that pops up as part of the menu, type in
    \texttt{Terminal} and hit return.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Linux Command Line}

Please read Chapters 1 through 4 and the section on \texttt{man} in Chapter 5 of
the following book:
\begin{center}
  \url{http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php}
\end{center}

While this is a lot of material, you do not need to know everything in detail.
You merely need to know how to navigate the file system. Your lecturing lab TA
will also take you through this in lab.

\subsection{Start Python}

In the shell, type \texttt{python3}. It is important that you not use
\texttt{python}, but \texttt{python3}! It should look something like this:

\begin{bashcode}
$ python3
Python 3.3.2 (default, Jun 30 2014, 12:45:18) 
[GCC 4.8.2 20131212 (Red Hat 4.8.2-7)] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
\end{bashcode}

\subsection{Summary}

Commands to know for next lab:
\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{itemize}
  \item cd
  \item pwd
  \item man
  \item ls
  \item mkdir
  \item cp
  \item mv
  \item rm
  \item touch
  \item cat
  \item less
  \item script
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\begin{warningbox}{Quiz}
  We will likely have a quiz about the above commands at the beginning of lab 2.

\section{Python as a Calculator}
\label{sec:python-calc}
Forgot ever using your calculator! Python rocks as a calculator.

\begin{bashcode}
$ python3
Python 3.4.1 (v3.4.1:c0e311e010fc, May 18 2014, 10:38:22) [MSC
v.1600 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
>>> 
\end{bashcode}

Note the first line thing printed out: \texttt{Python 3.4.1}. This is the
version of Python that is running. Make sure you have \emph{Python 3} or higher.

At the Python prompt \texttt{>>>} you can type in Python statements and
immediately see the result. For instance, to add 2 + 3, simply type \texttt{2 +
3}: 

\begin{python3code}
>>> 2 + 3
5
>>>
\end{python3code}

Notice that after a statement is executed, you are given a prompt to enter
another statement. The \texttt{+} is the addition operator. Other basic math
operators in python include:

\begin{description}
  \item[Subtraction] \texttt{-} subtracts the right hand operand from the left
    hand operand:

    \begin{python3code}
>>> 2 - 3
-1
    \end{python3code}

  \item[Multiplication] \texttt{*} multiplies values on either side of the
    operator:

    \begin{python3code}
>>> 2 * 3
6
    \end{python3code}

  \item[Division] \texttt{/} divides the left hand operand by the right hand
    operand, while \texttt{//} does the division and cuts off the decimals. The
    latter is called \emph{floor division}.

  \begin{python3code}
>>> 2 / 3
0.6666666666666666
>>> 2 // 3
0
>>> 2 / 3.0
0.6666666666666666
>>> 2 // 3.0
0.0
>>> 2. / 3.
0.6666666666666666
>>> 2 / float(3)
0.6666666666666666
  \end{python3code}

    This is an example of a major difference between Python 2 and Python 3. If
    you are using Python 2 some of these calculations will give different
    results. Make sure you are using Python 3.

    Using \texttt{/} will always include the decimal portion of the answer. If
    you wish to drop the decimal portion, you must use \texttt{//}. Dropping the
    decimal portion of the answer is called integer division (since your answer
    will always be an integer) or floor division (since it will always round
    down).

  \item[Modulus] \texttt{\%} divides the left hand operand by the right hand
    operand and gives you the remainder.

    \begin{python3code}
>>> 5 % 3
2
>>> 3 % 5
3
    \end{python3code}

    This is as it was in elementary school: If you divide 7 by 3, 3 goes into 7
    twice with a remainder of one. Modulus will become more important later in
    your CS life.

    Modulus can, for example, tell you whether an integer is even or odd:

    \begin{python3code}
>>> 5 % 2
1
>>> 6 % 2
0
    \end{python3code}
    For even integers, division by two will always yield a remainder of zero.
    For odd integers, division by two will always yield a remainder of one.

  \item[Exponentiation] \texttt{**} performs exponential (power) calculation.
    \texttt{a ** b} means a raised to b.

    \begin{python3code}
>>> 10 ** 5
100000
>>> 5 ** 10 
9765625
>>> 9 ** .5
3.0
>>> 5.5 ** 6.8
108259.56770464421
    \end{python3code}

%    Besides fractional powers, Python can handle very large numbers. Try raising
%    10 to the 100th power (a googol)
%
%    \begin{python3code}
%>>> 10 ** 100
%10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
%000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000L
%    \end{python3code}
%
%    The \texttt{L} at the end of the number indicates it is a long. Long
%    integers are integers that are too big to represent with a normal integer.
%    In general you are able to treat integers and longs as equivalent data
%    types.
\end{description}

Of course, these commands can be combined to form more complex expressions. They
follow typical precedence rules, with \texttt{**} having higher precedence than
\texttt{*}, \texttt{/}, \texttt{\%}, and \texttt{//}, which have higher
precedence than \texttt{+} and \texttt{-}. If operators have equal precedence
they execute left to right. You can always use parentheses to change the
precedence.

\begin{python3code}
>>> 6 * 5 % 4 - 6 ** 7 + 80 / 3 #((6 * 5) % 4) - (6 ** 7) + (80 / 3)
-279908
>>> 6 * 5 % 4
2
>>> 6 * (5 % 4)
6
>>> (6 * 5) % 4
2
\end{python3code}

The \texttt{\#} indicates the start of a comment. Comments are ignored by the
interpreter and can be used to provide reminders to yourself as to what a
section of code does.

The real power of Python as a calculator comes when you add variables. Using
\texttt{=} allows you to assign a value to a variable. A variable can have any
name consisting of letters, numbers, and underscores. Once a variable has been
assigned, it can be used in future computations.

\begin{python3code}
>>> x = 7
>>> y = 5 + x
>>> y
12
>>> x
7
\end{python3code}

In general, you should try to give your variables descriptive names so that it is
clear what they are meant to store; for example:

\begin{python3code}
>>> food_price = 4.50
>>> drink_price = 1.00
>>> subtotal = food_price + drink_price
>>> tax = subtotal * 0.07
>>> total = subtotal + tax
>>> total
5.885
\end{python3code}

\section{Running Python Programs}

So far, you have been running Python interactively. This is a nice feature as it
lets you test ideas quickly and easily. However, there are times you want to
save your ideas to a text file and to run the code as a program. Your programs
will be almost identical to what you enter when using the Python interpreter,
though you will have to use the \texttt{print} function in order to display
output.

Open a text editor (e.g. type \texttt{gedit} in the command line) and create a
one line Python program as following:

\begin{python3code}
print('Hello, world!')
\end{python3code}

\texttt{print} is a function. It will print the value of whatever is within its
parentheses. In order to print plaintext (not variables), you must additionally
surround it with quotes. This is called a string. It is important to note that

\begin{python3code}
print("Hello, world!")
\end{python3code}

is equivalent to the first example.

\texttt{\textbackslash n} prints a newline. This means that the text following
the \texttt{\textbackslash n} will start on a new line. Test this with the
following example:

\begin{python3code}
print('Hello, world!\nHow are you?')
\end{python3code}

Save your file as \texttt{hello.py}. The \texttt{py} extension indicates it is a
Python file.

If you are using Linux, type \texttt{python3 hello.py} to run from a program
from a file.

\begin{bashcode}
$ python3 hello.py
Hello, world!
How are you?
$
\end{bashcode}

You can also print out the values of variable that you may have assigned earlier
in the program.

\begin{python3code}
x = 5
y = 4
print(y)
y = y + x
print(y)
\end{python3code}

\begin{bashcode}
4
9
\end{bashcode}

But what if you wish to print a variable's value on the same line as another
string? Unfortunately, the simplest method of doing this does not work:

\begin{python3code}
>>> x = 5
>>> print('x = ' + x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#9>", line 1, in <module>
    print('x = ' + x)
TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly
\end{python3code}

However, we can get around this by converting \texttt{x} into a string using
\texttt{str()}.

\begin{python3code}
>>> x = 5
>>> print('x = ' + str(x))
x = 5
\end{python3code}

At this point it is not necessary to completely understand the differences
between a string and an actual number, just remember that \pythoninline{x = '5'}
and \pythoninline{x = 5} denote different things.

\section{More Math}

In Python, you can do many more things mathematical. Python can be your
replacement for a TI-89!

It is as simple as the following line of code:

\begin{python3code}
>>> import math
>>>
\end{python3code}

Then, try out some of the functions:

\begin{python3code}
>>> math.sqrt(16)
4.0
>>> math.log(8, 2) # $\log_2(8)$
3.0
>>> math.pow(2, 3) # $2^3$
8.0
>>> math.pi
3.14...
>>>
\end{python3code}

There are more functions in the math library, you can find them documented here:
\begin{center}
\url{https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/math.html}
\end{center}

\section{Exercises}
\subsection{Conversions}
Download \texttt{conversions.py}. It is a simple Python program for converting
temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin. We would like to modify it to also convert
the temperatures to Fahrenheit. Currently, the output of the program is
something like this:

\begin{bashcode}
Please input a temperature in Celsius: 10
Kelvin temperature: 283.15
\end{bashcode}

Add code (you should not need to modify the existing lines, though you are free
to) so that its output is as follows:

\begin{bashcode}
Please input a temperature in Celsius: 10
Kelvin temperature: 283.15
Fahrenheit temperature: 50.0
\end{bashcode}

\subsection{Shapes}
Download \texttt{shapes.py}. It is the start of a Python program to display
information about shapes. Currently it gets the of the radius of a circle and
the three sides of a box. Using this information, add additional code to compute
the circumference and area of the circle as well as the volume and surface area
of the box.

That is, we want the output of the program to looking something like this:

\begin{bashcode}
Please input the radius of the circle: 3
The circumference of the circle is 18.84
The area of the circle is 28.26
Please input the width of the box: 2
Please input the height of the box: 6
Please input the length of the box: 4
The surface area of the box is 88.0
The volume of the box is 48.0
\end{bashcode}

\pagebreak
\section{Submitting}

You may submit your code as either a tarball (instructions below) or as a .zip
file. Either one should contain all files used in the exercises for this lab.
The submitted file should be named either
\texttt{cse107\_firstname\_lastname\_lab1.zip} or
\texttt{cse107\_firstname\_lastname\_lab1.tar.gz} depending on which method you
used.

\subsection{Linux}

Tar is used much the same way that Zip is used in Windows: it combines many
files and/or directories into a single file. Gzip is used in Linux to compress a
single file, so the combination of Tar and Gzip do what Zip does. However, Tar
deals with Gzip for you, so you will only need to learn and understand one
command for zipping and extracting.

In the terminal (ensure you are in your \texttt{lab1} directory), type the
following command, replacing \texttt{firstname} and \texttt{lastname} with your
first and last names:

\begin{bashcode}
$ tar czvf cse107_firstname_lastname_lab1.tar.gz *.py
\end{bashcode}

This creates the file \texttt{cse107\_firstname\_lastname\_lab1.tar.gz} in the
directory. The resulting archive, which includes every python file in your
\texttt{lab1} directory, is called a tarball. 

To check the contents of your tarball, run the following command:

\begin{bashcode}
$ tar tvf cse107_firstname_lastname_lab1.tar.gz
\end{bashcode}

You should see a list of your Python source code files.

  \textbf{Upload your tarball to Canvas.}
