\section{Exercises}
\label{sec:ex}

\begin{warningbox}{Cars Are Hard}
  \emph{Warning}: The following exercise was designed with little regard for
  how cars and physics actually work in the real world. Sorry.
\end{warningbox}

\begin{ex}[car.py, tire.py, engine.py, race.py]
  For this project, you will be submitting four files:

  \pythoninline{car.py} will contain the definition of \pythoninline{class Car}. A
  Car will have an \pythoninline{Engine} and a \pythoninline{Tire}  (representing all 4)
  as attributes. Additionally, each car should have an attribute representing its name.
  Additionally, a Car should have a method \pythoninline{travel_time(self, time)} that returns
  the distance that the Car travels in the time given as well as a method
  \pythoninline{travel_dist(self, dist)} that returns the time it takes for the Car to travel
  the given distance. Both methods should assume that
  the car starts at a standstill and accelerates throughout the travel time. The results
  should take into account the attributes of the Car's Tire and Engine.
  
  \pythoninline{tire.py} will contain the definition of \pythoninline{class Tire}. Each Tire
  will have two attributes: traction and radius. The traction of the wheel indicates the
  maximum ideal acceleration the wheel can provide. If the car's acceleration would be
  above this number, then it is instead the average of this number and the
  ideal acceleration. The radius of the tire determines how far it causes the
  car to travel per rotation. This is important because Engine strength is
  measured in rotations. Traction and radius are both measured in meters.
  
  \pythoninline{engine.py} will contain the definition of
  \pythoninline{class Engine}. Each Engine will have two attributes:
  max speed and acceleration. Max speed is in terms of tire rotations per
  second. Acceleration is a value between $0$ and $1$ that indicates how much
  closer the current speed gets to the max speed each second. Each second, the
  new speed is determined by the following formula:
  $$newSpeed = oldSpeed + acceleration \cdot \left(maxSpeed - oldSpeed\right)$$
  Since engine speed is measured in rotations per second, the actual
  acceleration of the car must take into account the engine's speed, the tire's
  traction, and the tire's radius to determine how far it travels each second.
  Because of the tire's traction, it is possible that the car is not
  experiencing the full speed that might be indicated by
  $engineSpeed \cdot tireRadius$. Thus, the car's speed cannot be purely
  calculated from the engine's speed each second.

  \pythoninline{race.py} will contain your \pythoninline{main()} function and will
  manipulate the classes from the other files.
