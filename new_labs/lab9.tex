  Remember that this lab \emph{must} use the
  boilerplate syntax introduced in Lab~5.

\begin{description}
\item[rps.py] Write a program that connects to the server running at
  104.131.56.87 port 50001 and plays a game of rock, paper, scissors. The server
  will send the following messages:

  \begin{description}
    \item[name] Next message sent will be your client's display name.
    \item[taken] The name sent is already in use. Repeat sending a name.
    \item[wait] Game has not yet been found (waiting for another player). No
      response required.
    \item[opponent <name>] A game has been found. The opponent's name will be
      inserted for ``<name>''. No response required.
    \item[play] The next message sent should consist solely of ``r'', ``p'', or
      ``s'', depending on whether you wish to play rock, paper, or scissors.
    \item[tie] Your opponent played the same as you, causing a tie. No response
      required.
    \item[win] Your play beat your opponent's, so you won. The next
      message should consist solely of ``y'' or ``n'', indicating your desire to
      play again.
    \item[lose] Your opponent's play beat yours, so you lost. The next message
      should consist solely of ``y'' or ``n'', indicating your desire to play
      again.  
    \item[disconnect] Your opponent disconnected at an unexpected time.  The
      next message should consist solely of ``y'' or ``n'', indicating your
      desire to find a new opponent.
    \item[again] The next message should consist solely of ``y'' or ``n'',
      indicating your desire to play again. This message will only occur if
      invalid input is given for ``win'', ``lose'', or ``disconnect'', so if
      you can be sure that will not occur you do not necessarily need this
      case.
  \end{description}

  Every message sent will be terminated with a ``\textbackslash{}n''. Every message you send
  should be terminated with a ``\textbackslash{}n''. It is possible when you read from a socket
  that you receive multiple commands at once, or less than a full command. Check
  for ``\textbackslash{}n'' to know where each command ends. If you receive part of a command, you
  will have to store that partial command until you get the rest of it.

  For each of these server responses, you need to display an appropriate message
  with a prompt for input if appropriate. For example, a ``win'' message might
  output ``Congratulations, you beat <otherplayer>! Do you want to play again?''

\section{Submitting}

Files to submit:
\begin{itemize}
  \item rps.py (Section~\ref{sec:ex})
\end{itemize}

You may submit your code as either a tarball (instructions below) or as a .zip
file. Either one should contain all files used in the exercises for this lab.
The submitted file should be named either
\texttt{cse107\_firstname\_lastname\_lab9.zip} or
\texttt{cse107\_firstname\_lastname\_lab9.tar.gz} depending on which method you
used.

For Windows, use a tool you like to create a \texttt{.zip} file. The TCC
computers should have \texttt{7z} installed. For Linux, look at lab 1 for
instructions on how to create a tarball or use the ``Archive Manager'' graphical
tool.

\begin{center}
  \textbf{Upload your tarball or .zip file to Canvas.}
