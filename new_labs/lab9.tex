\begin{warningbox}{Boilerplate}
  Remember that this lab \emph{must} use the
  boilerplate syntax introduced in Lab~5, including the review exercises.
\end{warningbox}

\begin{description}
\item[rps.py] Write a program that connects to the server running at 104.131.56.87
  port 50000 and plays a game of rock, paper, scissors. The server will send the
  following messages:
  \begin{description}
  \item[username] Next message sent will be your client's display name.
  \item[taken] The name sent is already in use. Repeat sending a name.
  \item[wait] Game has not yet been found (waiting for another player). No response
    required.
  \item[opponent <name>] A game has been found. The opponent's name will be inserted for ``<name>''. No response required.
  \item[play] The next message sent should consist solely of ``r'', ``p'', or ``s'', depending on whether you wish to play rock, paper, or scissors.
  \item[tie] Your opponent played the same as you, causing a tie. No response required.
  \item[win] Your play beat your opponent's, so you won. The next message should consist solely of ``y'' or ``n'', indicating your desire to play again.
  \item[lose] Your opponent's play beat yours, so you lost. The next message should consist solely of ``y'' or ``n'', indicating your desire to play again.
  \item[disconnect] Your opponent disconnected at an unexpected time. The next message should consist solely of ``y'' or ``n'', indicating your desire to find a new opponent.
  \end{description}

  For each of these server responses, you need to display an appropriate message with a prompt for input if appropriate. For example, a ``win'' message might output ``Congratulations, you beat <otherplayer>! Do you want to play again?''
\end{description}

\section{Submitting}

Files to submit:
\begin{itemize}
  \item sum.py (Section~\ref{sec:ex})
\end{itemize}

You may submit your code as either a tarball (instructions below) or as a .zip
file. Either one should contain all files used in the exercises for this lab.
The submitted file should be named either
\texttt{cse107\_firstname\_lastname\_lab8.zip} or
\texttt{cse107\_firstname\_lastname\_lab8.tar.gz} depending on which method you
used.

For Windows, use a tool you like to create a \texttt{.zip} file. The TCC
computers should have \texttt{7z} installed. For Linux, look at lab 1 for
instructions on how to create a tarball or use the ``Archive Manager'' graphical
tool.

\begin{center}
  \textbf{Upload your tarball or .zip file to Canvas.}
