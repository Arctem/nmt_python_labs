\section{Submitting}

Files to submit:
\begin{itemize}
%  \item conversions.py (see Section~\ref{subsec:ifex})
\end{itemize}

You may submit your code as either a tarball (instructions below) or as a .zip
file. Either one should contain all files used in the exercises for this lab.
The submitted file should be named either
\texttt{cse107\_firstname\_lastname\_lab3.zip} or
\texttt{cse107\_firstname\_lastname\_lab3.tar.gz} depending on which method you
used.

For Windows, use a tool you like to create a \texttt{.zip} file. The TCC computers should
have \texttt{7z} installed. For Linux, look at lab 1 for instructions on how to
create a tarball or use the ``Archive Manager'' graphical tool.

\begin{center}
  \textbf{Upload your tarball or .zip file to Canvas.}
