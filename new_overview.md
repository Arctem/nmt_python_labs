#Contents of each lab

##Lab 1 - Introduction to Python
- IDLE
- Python as calculator (basic operators)
- Difference between float and int
- Variables

##Lab 2 - Basic Flow Control
- If/else
- While loops
	- both while waiting for something and doing a set number of times - poor man's for loop)
- input()
- Turtle
- Calling functions inside one another

##Lab 3 - Lists and Strings
- Lists
- Strings
- For loops
- Maybe range(), but I think we should focus more on for loops being used in the style of "for each"

##Lab 4 - Functions
- Functions
- main() boilerplate
- Comments


##Lab 5 - Advanced Lists and Strings
- String/list slicing.
- in operator
- list.sort() versus sorted(list)
- str.split()
- Nested lists (to prep for dictionaries)

##Lab 6 - Dictionaries
- dictionaries
- Maybe markov? Might work better as later lab or project.

##Lab 7 - Advanced Functions
- Default Parameter values
- Recursion
- One of:
	- Functions as first-class citizens
	- Lambda functions

##Lab 8 - File I/O


##Lab 9


##Other Notes
I think Turtle should be used in almost every lab, since it encourages them to toy around with what looks cool in it. It also allows us to give more open-ended assignments while giving them a set of tools so that they can work out how to accomplish the goal on their own rather than having labs that step them through each part.

I also think labs should be shorter. I think a longer length pushes them more towards rushing to finish it all rather than really understanding every part.

The key of the labs should be introducing new topics as better ways to accomplish previous things rather than "here's another thing you need to know". I think this will make it far easier for them to grock new topics, since they can tie them to previously learned material.

##Can Go Anywhere
- tuples
- type
- str.format()

##Possibles for later labs
- Functions as first-class citizens
- Lambda functions
- Generators
- Iterators
- Decorators

##Added
###IDLE
I think this works better as a dev environment. It has a built in python shell as well as an editor, meaning they only need to have one program in order to work on their code. It also is available on any platform. It isn't perfect, but I think it's good enough.

##Removed
###Unix
They will learn this in 113, and it lets us focus more on coding than on teaching them how to use the command line. This also allows us to not force them all to install Linux (though we're free to heavily encourage it)

###Shebangs
Unneeded and confusing without Unix knowledge. Even last semester few knew what they actually did or used them.

###tarballs
Can't easily tarball without teaching Unix, not sure how best to get around this. Can probably just have them use a GUI tool.

###ipython
In favor of IDLE.
