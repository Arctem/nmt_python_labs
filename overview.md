#Lab contents

Contents and instructional goals for spring 2015 semester.

##Lab 1 - Introduction to Linux and Python
- Python as calculator (basic operators)
- Python interpreter
- Difference between float and int -- talk a bit about float, int (, maybe str)
- Variables
- Read the docs!

##Lab 2 - Basic Flow Control
- Boolean logic
- If/else
- While loops
  - both while waiting for something and doing a set number of times - poor man's for loop
- Basic string formating
- input()
- Turtle

##Lab 3 - Functions
- Functions
- import statements
- main() boilerplate?
- Comments and PEP-8 style

##Lab 4 - Lists and Strings
- Lists
- Strings
- For loops
- Slicing
- in, not in keyword.
- Maybe range(), but I think we should focus more on for loops being used in the
  style of "for each"
- Talk about types -- we now have float, int, str, list(, function)

##Lab 5 - File I/O and matplotlib
- File I/O using with
- matplotlib
- data processing for exercises

##Lab 6a and 6b - Collections (6b during midterms)
- dictionaries, lists, tuples, sets

##Lab 7 - Programming Competition (post-midterm lab)
- algorithm development (redo some questions!)

##Labs 8 through 12 - undecided

##Foci
- Algorithm development, critical thinking
  - Introduce common CS algorithms early: binary search, sorting, etc.
  - Play around with interdisciplinary themes: genetics, linguistics, physics
- Earlier labs: use turtle to demonstrate concepts
- Later labs: start building ONE project

##Possibilities for later labs
- Functions as first-class citizens
- Higher order functions
- Lambda functions
- Generators
- Object-oriented?
